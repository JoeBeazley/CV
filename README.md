Puyan Wei

Hi there! I am currently student of Makers Academy and an ex online poker player who gave it all up to pursue an amazing career of a developer.

I'm interested in the creation and exploration of ideas. As a graduate of the London College of Communication in Interactive Design, I have always been interested in how people and technology interact within different environments.

I absolutely love the process of learning. "Enjoy the Process Towards Mastery" is one of my life mottos, inspired from Daniel Pink's amazing book "Drive". There I have learned to not be too attached to the results of success or failure to keep striving for self improvement.

SKILLS

Initiative and Commitment

Upon my early pursuits in online poker, I soon realized that mentorship would speed up my learning considerably. I very quickly got in contact with reputable teachers to improve as efficiently as possible.

The autonomy I had was a blessing but also a hindrance too. It was apparent to me after a short period of time that I needed strict scheduling and goals setting in order to achieve my targets. Goals were emphasized for quality of performance, off table studying and not money made.

At the end of 2016, I gave up online poker and decided to pursue the goal of learning to code. This was a simple transition for myself due to my experience with scheduling and studying. Within 4 months I had learned some Java, Javascript, completed some courses on udacity and freecodecamp, and built some basic games. Commitment is not an issue with me when I know what I want.


Analytics and Adaptability

The fast pace world of online poker demanded a lot of quick efficient decision making skills whilst under constant pressure. This is ramped up by playing multiple tables at the same time simultaneously, usually up to 18 in order to increase my hourly.

Offline study helped me with improving on-the-fly equity analysis and mathematical calculations as well as adjusting to opponent tendencies according to the data collected, allowing myself to implement the most efficient strategy.

Working in a team I like to take these things into consideration as well. As a bartender we adjusted to each other's strengths and weaknesses, as well as adapting accordingly to when times are busy and when things are more relaxed where we can connect with customers.

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.


Creativity

As a graduate of the University of the Arts London, I pride myself on my creativity and ideas.

One of our projects we worked as a team to debunk the idea that advertising has to spammy in order to be successful. We created a campaign called "Off The Wall", of which various items were left around south London with our branding on it with a link to our website that explained what we were trying to achieve. This ended in an exhibition event of our work, with plenty of documentation of responses from the public.

I love blogging and documenting my ideas. My blog has about 90,000 views at the moment and I recently transitioned it from talking about poker to coding. During my successes in poker I chose to travel quite a lot, exploring Asia mostly. I find writing very therapeutic and it is really interesting to look back on what I wrote and see how I have developed over time.
